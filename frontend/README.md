How to use the React app in development mode.

1) Run "npm install" in the main 'frontend' folder
2) Run "npm start" to view the project

*Note: 
- The fontend can run independently, provided the "proxy" property is specified accordingly in the package.json file
````
"proxy": "http://localhost:8080"
````
 The same goal can be achieved by using 'axios' library to point to the back-end.
